# synon

**Taxonomic translations to a custom checklist**

`synon` is an R package for standardizing vascular plant scientific names in large, messy datasets—especially herbarium specimen data—by translating synonyms to accepted names using a prioritized, transparent workflow.

It is designed for real-world taxonomic chaos: outdated names, inconsistent infraspecific ranks, regional checklists, and spelling variation.

## ✨ Key Features

- Works with **large datasets** (tens to hundreds of thousands of names)
- Supports **custom target checklists**
- Uses a **hierarchical translation strategy**:
  1. Direct matches to the checklist
  2. User-supplied synonym tables
  3. Built-in synonym tables
  4. Optional exact and fuzzy matching via **WCVP**
- Preserves **provenance** of every translation
- Never overwrites an already-resolved name
- Optional handling of **infraspecific names** via binomial fallback
- Caches expensive fuzzy matching results for reuse

## 📦 Built-in Synonym Sources

`synon` ships with curated synonym lookup tables from:

- **NatureServe Network (USA/Canada)**
- **SEINet**
- **USDA PLANTS**
- **World Checklist of Vascular Plants (WCVP)**

These tables are filtered dynamically to your target checklist to minimize spurious translations.

## User-supplied Synonym Sources

Dataframes must have *inputName* and *outputName* columns

## 🔧 Installation

You can install synon directly from GitHub using the `remotes` package:

```r
# Install remotes if you don't already have it
install.packages("remotes")

# Install synon from GitHub
remotes::install_github("chollenb-cnhp/synon")
```

After installation, load the package:

```r
library(synon)

?synonymize
```

## Additional downloads for optional fuzzy matching

Fuzzy matching requires download of rWCVP and rWCVP data:
See https://matildabrown.github.io/rWCVP/ and **cite appropriately if fuzzy matching** used!

If desired:
```r
# install.packages("remotes")
devtools::install_github("matildabrown/rWCVP")
```

## Example usage:

```r
translated_df <- synonymize(input_df,
                       name_col = "scientificName",
                       checklist = NA,                # usually a state or regional checklist maintained by a Natural Heritage Program. Otherwise, defaults to NatureServe global.
                       checklist_name_col = "SNAME",
                       synonym_LUTs = list(),       # custom user supplied synonym tables.
                       synonym_sources = c("NatureServe", "SEINet", "USDA", "WCVP"),
                       synonym_sources_rerun = FALSE,
                       fuzzy = FALSE,
                       wcvp_rerun = FALSE,
                       ssp_mods = TRUE,
                       cross_check = TRUE)
```
